# Diabetes-Prediction
In this Project I'm have predicted the diabetes of a person whether he/she have diabetes or not using the Kaggle dataset. The three machine learning algorithm I'm have used are Logistic regression,Random Forest and XGB Classifier. In the end I have also provided the comparison between this different Machine Learning Models.
